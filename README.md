# igloo_access

Here is my code (custom_pin) to make a custom pin code for my lock. The algopin_2h code is for an example that works for me.
All sensitive tokens have been removed from the source code for security reasons.

"Algopin_2h"

The algopin_2h script generates a PIN code valid for 2 hours. This code uses an algorithm to create a temporary PIN, configured to remain active for a preset duration of 2 hours. Once generated, the code is active during this period and automatically expires afterward.

Basic Functionality:
Generates a temporary PIN code for limited-time access.
Validity duration: 2 hours.
Designed for temporary access requiring enhanced security.
The generated PIN code is relatively long for added security.


"Custom_pin"

The custom_pin script is designed to create a customizable PIN code, allowing the user to set a specific code manually. Additionally, it enables shorter PIN codes (up to 6 digits) for ease of use, unlike the longer code generated by algopin_2h. Users can also specify the start date and time for the PIN's validity. Currently, this code does not function correctly and requires adjustments.

Expected Functionality:
Allows the user to choose a custom PIN code with specific parameters (e.g., start date and time).
Supports shorter PIN codes (maximum of 6 digits) for convenience.
Currently, the script encounters technical issues and does not generate the PIN as expected.
